Welcome to 'Among Us', the ultimate web browser game that takes
inspiration from the wildly popular computer original. In this game,
you'll find yourself on a spaceship mission with a team of fellow
astronauts, but little do you know, there are infiltrators among you
trying to sabotage the mission. As you navigate through the spaceship
completing tasks, keep your eyes peeled for anyone acting
suspiciously. You never know who the infiltrators might be, so it's
important to work together with your team to uncover their true
identity. When an emergency meeting is called, you'll have to defend
your innocence and cast your vote for who you believe is the
infiltrator. But be careful, because the infiltrators are skilled at
deception and will stop at nothing to throw you off their trail. With
immersive graphics and fast-paced gameplay, 'Space Infiltrators' will
keep you on the edge of your seat as you work to uncover the
infiltrators and save the mission. Can you work together with your
team to save the day, or will the infiltrators succeed in their
mission?
